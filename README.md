This project mainly do 2 things self parking car (Assuming we have a smart garage where cars park on them selves in here we used Ultra sonic sensor + servo motor + esp 8266 chip to connect with server ) 
self driving CAr is the other thing that this project does ( for self driving car you will find most of the code in arduino code) 
plus it communicates with a server through HiveMQ(you can choose to edit that to any broker of your choose ) if not just edit the code where it links with HiveMQ broker with your own Broker cluster so you can monitor the Publish and Subscribes Through it 
There is a code for Esp 8266 to link with a Wifi of your choose (also edit the ssid and PWD of the wifi inside the esp code)
if you are having any Q's feel free to Mail me 
IF you want only the self parking car project out of this you can go to render for server free 
all what you go to do is sign in in render and create new server take the URL of this github project and let render runs it for you it will give ua server and a webbage 
long live the resistance <<Hamas>> FREE PALESTINE
